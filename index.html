          <p>
            My name is Oluwamuyiwa Sogbetun. I attended Lagos State University
            in Lagos, Nigeria where i studied Economics. Although i started my
            career journey as an economist but i was never filling fulfilled. My
            dream course and career is to be a programmer. For this reason i had
            drop out of the University to pursue my tech career. I so much love
            the tech space from my childhood but back in secondary school i made
            a wrong career choice by joining the commercial department rather
            than the science department. Although the odds were not right but i
            didn't let that stop me. Since i dropped out i have been learning on
            my Web development Career path relentlessly.

            I enjoy watching Football at a lot. My favorite club is Manchester
            United. My hobbies are engaging in problem solving research,
            watching and playing football and also going on adventures.

        <h3>Why i joined ALTSCHOOL</h3>
        <p>
          Like i said in my Biography, my dream career is to become a
          programmer. A programmer capable of contributing to problem solving
          projects. Before now, i have been a self learner. Making use of
          materials from Youtube and also from friends who were in the line of
          programming. I knew this isn't enough especially if i want to become a
          world class programmer and work for big tech companies but i was
          limited by finance.
        </p>
        <p>
          I Joined ALTSCHOOL by recommendation from a friend who finished as one
          of the top student from the institution. I was convinced that
          ALTSCHOOL will help me achieve my goal into becoming a world class
          programmer.
